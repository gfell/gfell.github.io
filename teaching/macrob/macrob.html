	<p>Instructor: Giulio Fella. Office hours: Monday 10-12 Room
	W302 <br /> 

	Lectures: Friday 9-12, E303 <br />
	
	<P>The <a href="syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> contains all the
	relevant information about the course. <br /> 

	<p>Every Thursday I will post below a brief description of the
	topics covered in the week's lecture together with a link to the
	relevant set of lecture notes and problem set. All links are
	grouped at the bottom of this page (<span style="color:red">note
	that the links will be activated week by week</span>).

	<!--   <\!-- <li value="10"><h4>26 March</h4>We covered the basic model of -\-> -->
	<!--   <\!-- matching unemployment. I have uploaded the text -\-> -->
	<!--   <\!-- of <a href="psets/pset7.pdf">problem set 7</a> for next week, -\-> -->

	<!--   <\!-- and question 7 that do not apply to this year's syllabus. -\-> -->


	<!--   <\!-- <li value="9"><h4>19 March</h4>We covered dynamic programming -\-> -->
	<!--   <\!-- in continuous time with discrete (binary) choices. We then -\-> -->
	<!--   <\!-- discussed why a search theory of unemployment is necessary to -\-> -->
	<!--   <\!-- explain the coexistence of unemployed workers and unfilled job -\-> -->

	<!--   <\!-- and the <a href="psets/sol5.pdf">solution to problem set 5</a>. -\-> -->
	  <li value="8"><h4>21 March</h4> We analyzed a simple model
	   of investment under fixed adjustment cost and covered the
	   papers by Khan and Thomas (2008) and Bachmann, Caballero and
	   Engle (2014). I have uploaded the  <a href="http://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/405095/mod_resource/content/1/solpset8.pdf?forcedownload=1">
	  solution to problem set 8</a>.


	  <li value="8"><h4>14 March</h4> We finished covering the
	  Abel-Hayashi model of investment under convex adjustment cost
	  and discussed the empirical implications of the model in the
	  light of the empirical evidence. I have uploaded the text
	  of <a href="psets/pset8.pdf">problem set 8</a> for next week
	  the <a href="http://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/405095/mod_resource/content/1/solpset7.pdf?forcedownload=1">
	  solution to problem set 7</a>.


	  <li value="8"><h4>7 March</h4> We started the part on
	  investment. We covered the Jorgensonian theory of investment
	  and started the Abel-Hayashi model of investment under convex
	  adjustment cost. I have uploaded the paper referred to at the
	  begining of the lecture notes on QMplus. It is in the folder
	  'Investment'.  I have uploaded the text
	  of <a href="psets/pset7.pdf">problem set 7</a> for next week
	  and the <a href="http://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/405095/mod_resource/content/1/solpset6.pdf?forcedownload=1"> solution to problem set
	  6</a>.

          <!-- <li value="8"><h4>7 March</h4>We discussed the equity -->
          <!-- volatility and the risk-free rate puzzles. I have uploaded -->
          <!-- the  <a href="psets/sol5.pdf">solution to problem set -->
          <!-- 5</a>. There is no problem set for next week. -->

          
          <li value="7"><h4>28 February</h4>We discussed the
          consumption-based capital asset pricing model. I have uploaded
          the text of <a href="psets/pset6.pdf">problem set 6</a> for
          next week and the <a href="http://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/405095/mod_resource/content/1/solpset5.pdf?forcedownload=1">solution to problem set
          5</a>. 

	  <li value="6"><h4>14 February</h4>We studied the overlapping
	  generation model and its implication for the correlation
	  between aggregate saving and growth rates. We discussed
	  Carroll and Summers's test of the model. We covered the
	  conditions for dynamic inefficiency of the decentralized
	  steady state equilibrium. I have uploaded the
	  text of <a href="psets/pset5.pdf">problem set 5</a> for next
	  week.

	 <li value="5"><h4>7 February</h4> We discussed the model by
	 Aiyagari (1994) and started the overlapping generations
	 model. I have uploaded the text
	 of <a href="psets/pset4.pdf">problem set 4</a> which is due
	 next week and
	 the <a href="http://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=296759">solution
	 to problem set 3</a>.

	  <li value="4"><h4>31 January</h4>We finished studying
	  precautionary saving with exponential utility and no borrowing
	  constraints. We saw how borrowing constraints also induce a
	  precautionary saving motive and how impatience
	  - beta*(1+r)<1 - is necessary for the consumption and wealth
	  distribution to be bounded when income is uncertain. I have
	  uploaded the text of <a href="psets/pset3.pdf">problem set
	  3</a> which is due next week,
	  the <a href="http://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=293848">solution to problem set 2</a> and
	  a <a href="psets/math_handout.pdf">math handout.</a>  Points
	  2. and 3. are two results that you need to answer question 2
	  in problem set 2. </a>.

	  <li value="3"><h4>24 January</h4>We derived the solution of
	  the permanent income model and discussed its empirical
	  implications.  I have uploaded the text
	  of <a href="psets/pset2.pdf">problem set 2</a>, which is due
	  next week and
	  the <a href="http://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=292522">solution
	  to problem set 1</a>.

	  <li value="2"><h4>17 January</h4>We finished discussing
	  dynamic programming. We highlighted the main motives for
	  saving. We introduced the permanent income model. I have
	  uploaded the text of <a href="psets/pset1.pdf">problem set
	  1</a>, which is due next week.

	  <li value="1"><h4>10 Jan</h4> After some methodological
	  preliminaries, we discussed dynamic programming and the
	  conditions under which the solution to the sequence and
	  recursive problem coincide.
