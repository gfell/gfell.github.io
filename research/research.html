The aim of this paper is to understand and quantify the forces behind this empirical regularity. We propose a structural model of the labor market with heterogeneous firms, on-the-job search and accumulation of specific and general human capital. Jobs are destroyed at an endogenous rate due to idiosyncratic productivity shocks and the skills of workers depreciate during periods of non-employment. The model is estimated on German Social Security data. By jointly matching moments related to workers&#8217; mobility and wages, the model can replicate the size and persistence of the losses in earnings and wages found in the data. We find that the loss of a job with a more productive employer is the primary driver of the cumulative wage losses following displacement (about 50 percent), followed by the loss of firm-specific human capital (about 30 percent).';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span><br>

<br> Abstract: <span onmouseover="this.innerHTML='The nature of productivity shocks is a central feature of models of heterogeneous-firm dynamics. Using firm-level data from Spain, we show that the observed productivity dynamics differ from those implied by the canonical, linear AR(1) representation with normally-distributed shocks.  We document that the productivity process features non-linear persistence and non-normality. Motivated by this, we estimate a flexible stochastic process for productivity which allows for these features and compare its implications with the canonical one. We find that the flexible model fits the productivity data much better. We also estimate non-parametric, semi-reduced form empirical investment functions and find that the two processes imply very different responses to productivity shocks. Those estimated under the flexible process fit much better the relationship between investment and productivity in the data.  Finally, we embed both the non-linear and the canonical process in a structural, partial equilibrium investment model and estimate capital adjustment costs under both specifications. The model estimated under the non-linear process fits the data much better and has very different implications for the relative importance of fixed versus quadratic costs of adjustment.';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span><br>

			<br> Abstract: <span onmouseover="this.innerHTML='The extent to which households can self-insure depends on family structure and wage risk. We calibrate a model of couples and singles&#8217; savings and labor supply under two types of wage processes. The first wage process is the canonical---age-independent, linear---one that is typically used to evaluate government insurance provision. The second wage process is a flexible one.  We use our model to evaluate the optimal mix of the two most common types of means-tested benefits---in-work versus income floor. The canonical wage process underestimates wage persistence for women and thus implies that in-work benefits should account for most benefit income. In contrast, the richer wage process that matches the wage data well, implies that the income floor should be the main benefit source, similarly to the system in place in the UK. This stresses that allowing for rich wage dynamics is important to properly evaluate policy.';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span><br>

We find that, in both countries, earnings display important deviations from the typical assumptions of linearity and normality. Individual-level male wage and earnings risk is relatively high at the beginning and end of the working life, and for those in the lower and upper parts of the income distribution. Hours are the main driver of the negative skewness and, to a lesser extent, the high kurtosis of earnings changes. Even though we find no evidence of added-worker effects, the presence of spousal earnings reduces the variability of household income compared to that of male earnings. In the Netherlands, government transfers are a major source of insurance, substantially reducing the standard deviation, negative skewness, and kurtosis of income changes. In the U.S. the role of family insurance is much larger than in the Netherlands. Family and government insurance reduce, but do not eliminate non-linearities in household disposable income by age and previous earnings in either country.';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span><br>

We find that Italian households have a degree of consumption insurance against permanent labor income shocks comparable to that in the model. We estimate that 12 percent of permanent labor income shocks in the data are insurable which is comparable to the  model counterpart of 9 percent. This result contrasts with existing evidence, and our own findings in this paper, for the US that households in the data have a higher degree of insurance against permanent  shocks than implied by an incomplete-markets model in which households can self-insure with a single, non-contingent asset.';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span>

<br> Abstract: <span onmouseover="this.innerHTML='Earnings dynamics are much richer than typically assumed in macro models with heterogeneous agents. This holds for individual-pre-tax and household-post-tax earnings and across administrative (Social Security Administration) and survey (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) data. We study the implications of two processes for household, post-tax earningsin a standard life-cycle model: a canonical earnings process (that includes a persistent and a transitory shock) and a rich earnings dynamics process (that allows for age-dependence of moments, non-normality, and nonlinearity in previous earnings and age). Allowing for richer earnings dynamics implies a substantially better fit of the evolution of  cross-sectional consumption inequality over the life cycle and of the individual-level degree of consumption insurance against persistent earnings shocks. Richer earnings dynamics also imply lower welfare costs of earnings risk.';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span>

We evaluate the performance of these methods in the context of a canonical life-cycle, income-fluctuation problem with a non-stationary income process. We also examine the case in which innovations to the persistent component of earnings are  modeled as draws from a mixture of Normal distributions.

This pattern of comovement poses a puzzle for both neoclassical and New-Keynesian models with intertemporally-optimizing agents. We extend a standard New-Keynesian model to allow for skill accumulation through past work experience, or learning-by-doing (LBD), following Chang, Gomes and Schorfheide (2002). An increase in government spending increases hours and, through the LBD mechanism, induces skill accumulation and, therefore, higher labor productivity and real wages in subsequent periods.  The associated fall in future marginal costs, lowers the expected rate of inflation and, through the monetary policy rule, current and future real interest rates.

Dynamic quantitative models of wealth inequality can help us understand and quantify the determinants of the outcomes that we observe in the data and to evaluate the consequences of policy reform. This paper surveys the savings mechanisms generated by the transmission of bequests and human capital, by preference heterogeneity, by rates of returns heterogeneity, by entrepreneurship, by richer earnings processes, and by medical expenses. It concludes that the transmission of bequests and human capital, entrepreneurship, and medical expense risk are crucial determinants of savings and wealth inequality.';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span>

	   166-181. <br> Abstract: <span onmouseover="this.innerHTML='This paper is a quantitative, equilibrium study of the insurance role of severance pay when workers face displacement risk and markets are incomplete. A key feature of ourmodel is that, in line with an established empirical literature, job displacement entails a persistent fall in earnings upon reemployment due to the loss of job-specific human capital. The model is solved numerically and calibrated to the US economy. In contrast to previous studies that analyzed severance payments in the absence of persistent earning losses, we find that the welfare gains from the insurance against job displacement afforded by severance pay are sizable. These gains are higher if, as in most OECD countries, severance pay increases with tenure. The result is a consequence of the higher persistence of earnings losses for workers with a larger stock of job-specific human capital at the time of displacement.';"onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span>

We find that targeting crime reductions through increases in high school graduation rates entails large efficiency and welfare gains. These gains are absent if the same crime reduction is achieved by increasing the length of sentences.

The method is illustrated using a consumer problem in which the consumer chooses both durable and non-durable consumption subject to a borrowing constraint.

Mandated severance pay matters only if binding real wage rigidities imply inefficient separation under employment at will. In such a case, large enough severance payments reduce job destruction, and increase job creation and social efficiency, under very mild conditions. Furthermore, mandated severance pay never results in inefficient labor hoarding. Whenever separation is jointly optimal,the parties agree to end the match with a spot severance payment below the statutory one.  The marginal effect of mandated severance pay is zero when its size exceeds that which induces the same allocation that would prevail in the absence of wage rigidity.

This allows the firm to capture a positive share of the return to the general component of training in all states of nature.

In the absence of reputational or other commitment devices, the time inconsistency of firing decisions prevents the existence of complete future employment markets and the price mechanism fails to internalize the pecuniary externality. Firing costs not only unambiguously increase aggregate employment, but provide a commitment device. As their effect is the same as that of a Pigovian tax on firing, a Pareto improvement can be obtained provided all or part of the cost accrues to workers.';" onmouseout="this.innerHTML='[...]';">[...]</span>
