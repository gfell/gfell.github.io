	  and Crime over the Life Cycle</a>, (with Giovanni Gallipoli).
	  This draft: July 2009.
	  <p> We develop an overlapping-generation, life-cycle model
	      with endogenous education and crime choices. Education and
	      crime depend on different dimensionsof heterogeneity. We
	      apply the model to property crime and calibrate it to
	      U.S.data. We compare two policies: subsidizing high school
	      completion and increasing the length of prison
	      sentences. We find that targeting crime reductions
	      throughincreases in high school graduation rates entails
	      large efficiency and welfare gains. These gains are absent
	      if the same crime reduction is achieved by increasing the
	      length of sentences. The cost-effectiveness of high school
	      subsidies increases significantly if they are targeted at
	      the wealth poor. We find that general equilibrium effects
	      explain half of the reduction in crime from subsidizing
	      high school and are non-negligible even for interventions
	      targeted at low levels of wealth. Crucially, the effect of
	      small equilibrium price changes is magnified by their
	      interaction with the underlying individual heterogeneity.

	   <li class="plain"><a href="pdf/opt_sev.pdf">Optimal Severance
	   Pay in a Matching Model</a>. This draft: November 2009.  

	   <p> This paper uses an equilibrium matching framework to
	   study jointly the optimal private provision of severance pay
	   and the allocational and welfare consequences of government
	   intervention in excess of optimal private arrangements. Firms
	   insure risk-averse workers by means of simple, explicit
	   employment contracts. Contracts can be renegotiated ex post
	   by mutual consent. It is shown that the privately optimal
	   severance payment is bounded below by the fall in lifetime
	   wealth associated with job loss. Simulations show that,
	   despite being a priori non-neutral, legislated severance
	   payments largely in excess of the private optimum are
	   effectively undone by renegotiation and have only small
	   allocational effects. Welfare falls. Yet, for deviations from
	   laissez faire in line with those observed for most OECD
	   countries, the welfare loss is small.

	   foundations for the bargaining solution used in the paper,

	   <li class="plain"><a href="http://www.econ.qmul.ac.uk/papers/wp/WP400.HTM">When
	   Do Firing Costs Matter?</a> This draft: February 1999.

	   <p> This paper uses a strategic bargaining framework to
	   reassess the effect of dismissal costs in models of voluntary
	   separation. It shows that firing, as opposed to inducing a
	   quit, is always an off-equilibrium strategy for firms in this
	   class of models. Thus, dismissal costs can affect payoffs
	   only if some exogenous event may force the firm to fire the
	   worker despite it being suboptimal, or if the firm's assets
	   are only partly specific to the relationship. In this latter
	   case, dismissal costs increase the specificity of the firm's
	   capital and depress ex post expected profits. In any case,
	   firing restrictions do not affect separation decisions, as
	   firms always find it profitable to induce workers to quit
	   whenever separation is efficient. Involuntary separation is
	   an essential feature of a world in which firing costs result
	   in a lower probability of separation. In such a world, they
	   may be welfare improving, as the separation rate is
	   inefficiently high in the absence of firing restrictions.

	   <p> The results in this paper will never be published as one
	   single paper. I include it here because it is a
	   self-contained, and cited, reference on the effects of firing
	   costs in environments with risk-neutral and homogeneous
	   workers. Only the result on the neutrality of firing taxes in
	   models of voluntary separation is available elsewhere
	   (<a href="pdf/firing_taxes.pdf">"When Do Firing Taxes
	   Matter?"</a> above).
